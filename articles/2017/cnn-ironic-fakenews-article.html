    <p>The Irony: CNN Pushes Article Bashing "Fake News"</p>
  </div>

  <div class="container">

      <p class="article-text">&emsp;&emsp;CNN Writer, Dakin Andone published a very ironic article bashing fake news, just this week. Dakin goes on to rant about RT, Brietbart, etc. Note that they are all right wing news networks. He claimed, "RT the russian goverment funded fake news website, claims Ben Shapiro is not a white nationalist! That is complete bogus, since we all know the many things Shapiro says, is racist, sexist, and xenophobic."</p>
      <br>
      <p class="article-text">&emsp;&emsp;Now here is the problem with that... RT never posted a single article about Ben Shapiro! Not only is the Fake News Network its self bashing fake news, but reporting fake news in the same sentence! I just do not see how this journlist still has his job! And of course just hours later after CNN got massive amounts of comments on the issue, they updated the article and removed that line. So CNN does recognize when they are reporting fake news. However the writer was actually defended. CNN claimed, "Dakin was fed false information about RT from, right wing trolls."</p>
      <p class="article-text">&emsp;&emsp;At this point they are basically commiting suicide! Why would Dakin accept information for an article from some random "right wing troll" on the internet? He wouldn't, no one would, it is simply cover. The deeper you get into a lie, the worse it will be when you get caught!</p>
