      <p class="article-text">&emsp;&emsp;Uber has recently decided that it will go through many changes. They accounced this plan about 2 months ago, and we are already seeing the outcome. Uber calls the plan "180 Days of Change."</p>
      <p class="article-text">&emsp;&emsp;One of the most notable changes that took place, was the adding of the tipping feature. Which (clearly) allows Uber riders to send their driver a tip, based on the distance of the ride. Since the adding of tips, drivers have racked up a total of $50 Million USD, in the first month.</p>
      <p class="article-text">&emsp;&emsp;Another change in the application was altering the window of time the rider is able to cancel a ride, from 5 minutes to 2.</p>
      <p class="article-text">&emsp;&emsp;The campaign came about a week after Uber fired some of their executives and when their CEO resigned. Uber is still waiting for a new CEO to fill the gap.</p>
